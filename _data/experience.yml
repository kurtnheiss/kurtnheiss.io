     As a member of the Product Management team I worked with globally distributed developer teams on the best way 
     to present their APIs to our customers. I  helped teams in Cluj, London, Singapore, and Campbell develop both 
     customer facing reference and use case information. 
     
     8x8 has an incredible data platform and these APIs enabled our customers to access a great deal of data.
     
     When I started at 8x8 there was no structured public API program in place. I was able to get the conversation started
     amongst the disparate development teams as to strategy and standardized processes. 
     
     Constant iteration and improvement seeking to challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service.
