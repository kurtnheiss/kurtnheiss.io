     As a Senior API Technical Writer I support LinkedInâ€™s Marketing Solutions - Partner Engineering team for the 
     LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform API. 
     
     I develop and edit external customer engineering documentation for the Marketing API library, role-based user access 
     controls, infrastructure, systems, tools, and software engineering practices. The Marketing APIs enable our customers develop and 
     design online posts, video ads, and other content for their services. 
     
     I design and organize content for new API products. I gather requirements for the customer support team in serving over more than 
     2000 LinkedIn partners. I oversee and implement document version control (via Github) across the marketing documentation library 
     in parallel with API version control. 
     
     A final editor and source of truth for information displayed on our partner documentation portal. Ongoing iteration on improvements in 
     display and content.

  job_title: API Product Owner

     As a member of the Product Management team I worked with globally distributed developer teams on the best way 
     to present their APIs to our customers. I  helped teams in Cluj, London, Singapore, and Campbell develop both 
     customer facing reference and use case information. 
     
     8x8 has an incredible data platform and these APIs enabled our customers to access a great deal of data.
     
     When I started at 8x8 there was no structured public API program in place. I was able to get the conversation started
     amongst the disparate development teams as to strategy and standardized processes. 
     
     Constant iteration and improvement seeking to challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service.
