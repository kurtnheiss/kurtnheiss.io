  Hi, I’m Kurt

  I’m a technical writer and developer relations professional specializing in API documentation, developer guides, and technical content strategy. With extensive experience at both established tech giants and startups, I bridge the gap between complex technologies and clear, developer-friendly documentation.

  My work focuses on creating high-quality API reference materials, tutorials, and DevRel content that empower developers to build, integrate, and innovate. I’m passionate about improving developer experience through well-structured documentation and engaging technical content.

  Currently based in San Jose, I’ve lived and worked in San Francisco, Orange County, Long Beach, and Seattle. I hold an MBA from Santa Clara University and a BS in Zoology from the University of Washington.
