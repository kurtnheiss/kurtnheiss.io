about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs

  I am a Developer Experience Professional and API Technical Content Strategist. I bridge the gap between complex Enterprise Software and clear, high-quality documentation, driving project success through strong Project Management leadership.

  With over 10 years of experience at tech giants like Google, Roku, and LinkedIn, my focus is on delivering top-tier results in complex, fast-paced environments.

  I am fluent in modern Documentation-as-Code (DaC) methodologies and have proactively invested in the skills necessary for the future of tech, including the Google Project Management Certification and training in AI strategy and implementation. I am energized by intellectual challenges and dedicated to securing a long-term, high-impact role where I can apply a strategic, full-time commitment to driving corporate success.

  I hold an MBA from the Santa Clara University, Leavey School of Business and a BS in Zoology from the University of Washington.
 
  I am currently based in San Jose, CA.

  I believe in sustained vigor and unwavering focus, treating personal development as an extension of professional excellence. My high energy and dedication to structure are constants, ensuring I am always prepared for the next challenge.

  My free time is dedicated to rigorous, high-value self-investment that aligns with future career goals - 

  * Continuous Skill Acquisition - I actively pursue new competencies that align with both professional growth and personal passion. I am completing the Google Project Management Certification and the Generative AI Learning Path, alongside studying Google API Development and Python Programming.

  * Focus on Structure - Like my professional life, I thrive on structure and process. I enjoy the controlled challenge of reading and cooking, which provides focus and creative balance outside of the office.

  My personal interests reflect a commitment to complex, structured challenges that maintain mental and physical resilience -

  * Physical Conditioning - Surfing, Swimming, Weight Training, Biking, and Hiking—routines specifically designed for sustained energy and maintaining the vitality required for demanding professional life.

  * Creative & Intellectual Pursuits - Writing screenplays, sculpting (clay and papier mâché), advanced music study (cello, guitar/bass, creating music via Logic), and learning languages (German and Dutch).
