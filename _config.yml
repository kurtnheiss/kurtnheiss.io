I am a technical content and developer experience leader specializing in API Documentation, Generative AI (LLM) literacy, 
and high-stakes content strategy. I bridge the gap between complex engineering and clear, developer-friendly execution.

With over 10 years of experience at tech giants like Google, Roku, and LinkedIn, my focus is on delivering top-tier 
results in complex, fast-paced environments. My commitment to disciplined execution is evidenced by my 
Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Santa Clara University.

I am fluent in modern Documentation-as-Code (DaC) methodologies and have proactively invested in the skills necessary 
for the future of tech, including the Google Project Management Certification and training in AI Strategy (Andrew Ng`s `AI for Everyone`) 
and AI Implementation (Google AI Essentials/Python). I am energized by intellectual challenges and dedicated to securing a long-term, high-impact 
role where I can apply a strategic, full-time commitment to driving corporate success.

I hold a BS in Zoology from the University of Washington and am currently based in San Jose, CA.
