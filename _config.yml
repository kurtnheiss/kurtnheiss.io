about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs

  I am a Developer Experience Professional and API Technical Content Strategist. I bridge the gap between complex Enterprise Software and clear, high-quality documentation, driving project success through strong Project Management leadership.

  With over 10 years of experience at tech giants like Google, Roku, and LinkedIn, my focus is on delivering top-tier results in complex, fast-paced environments.

  I am fluent in modern Documentation-as-Code (DaC) methodologies and have proactively invested in the skills necessary for the future of tech, including the Google Project Management Certification and training in AI Strategy (Andrew Ng's 'AI for Everyone') and AI Implementation (Google AI Essentials/Python). I am energized by intellectual challenges and dedicated to securing a long-term, high-impact role where I can apply a strategic, full-time commitment to driving corporate success.

  I hold an MBA from the Santa Clara University, Leavey School of Business and a BS in Zoology from the University of Washington.
 
  I am currently based in San Jose, CA.

  A Little More About Me: Sustained Vigor and Curiosity
  
  I believe in continuous self-investment and maintaining the vitality required for a demanding professional life. My free time is dedicated to rigorous self-improvement, physical fitness, and intellectual challenge:

   * Continuous Skill Acquisition: I actively pursue new competencies that align with both professional growth and personal passion. I am currently enrolled in Coursera's Generative AI Learning Path (including Andrew Ng's 'AI for Everyone'), completing the Google Project Management Certification, and studying Google API Development and Python Programming.
   * Physical and Creative Disciplines: My personal interests reflect a commitment to complex, structured challenges:

     * Physical: Surfing, Swimming, Weight Training, and Hiking.

     * Creative & Intellectual: Writing screenplays, sculpting (clay and papier mâché), studying the cello, trying new techniques on the guitar/bass, creating music via Logic, and learning languages (German and Dutch).

   * Focus on Structure: Like my professional life, I enjoy the structure of reading and cooking, which provides focus and creative challenge outside of the office.
